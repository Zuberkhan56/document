-> nodejs is not a multithreaded environment.
-> When we write a web sever in nodejs, only a single thread is responsible for processing all the requests.

What is thread-local storage (TLS):
It is functionality that allows you to attach and retrieve data to the current processing thread from anywhere at anytime. 
It works by allocating specific memory to that thread.

What is thread-local storage used for?
Thread Local Storage (TLS) is the mechanism by which each thread 
in a given multithreaded process allocates storage for thread-specific data. In standard multithreaded programs,
data is shared among all threads of a given process, whereas thread local storage is the mechanism for allocating per-thread data
